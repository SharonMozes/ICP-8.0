                <p>Water is for all of us!<br>
                    Water is for me,<br>
                    Water is for you,<br>
                    Water is for animals,<br>        
                    Water is for birds, <br>              
                    Water is for plants,<br>
                    Water is for everyone,<br>
                    Water is for all of us!</p>

                        Water is resting in the ocean.<br>
                        Water is flowing in the sea with waves.<br>
                        Water is running in the rivers to help animals and people.<br>
                        Water is living in a small pond with fish and frogs.<br>
                        Water is helping us all with canals and dams.<br>
                        Water is living with us at our homes in our pots.

                    Save Water, Save Earth<br>
                    Wasting water is wrong<br>
                    Saving water is right<br>
                    Brushing your teeth is right<br>
                    Running taps are wrong<br>
                    Watering trees is right<br>
                    Throwing garbage in the water is wrong<br>
                    Bathing in a bucket is right<br>
                    Showering nonstop is wrong<br>
                    Saving water is right<br>
                    Wasting water is wrong.
